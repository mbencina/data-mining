# Buss arrival planning

### Based on previous data, plan the arrival of the LPP buses

Running *lpp.py* will create a file *napoved.txt* where it predicts arrival times for buses in *test.csv*. 
Training data is zipped, because of its size, so it needs to be unzipped before running *lpp.py*. A report in Slovenian is in *poročilo.pdf*
