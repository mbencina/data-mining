# Buss arrival planning

### Based on previous data, plan the arrival of the LPP buses

Running *lpp.py* will create a file *napoved.txt* where it predicts arrival times for buses in *test.csv*. 
Unfortunately I was not able to upload the training data, because the file was too big. A report in Slovenian is in *poročilo.pdf*
